            <br />
            Design, preparation of construction documents, and construction
            administration. Architects also provide a wide variety of services
            including feasibility studies, architectural programming and project

            The following is an outline of services typically offered by
            architects and their sub-consultants:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Project Inception- The planning of your project starts here.
                Working together with your architect, you will share your
                project needs, dreams and goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                {" "}
                Schematic Design – During this stage your architect will begin
                by preparing preliminary design sketches based on your
                requirements and budget to explore and illustrate possible
                options. The architect will review these options with you,
                pointing out the merits and responding to your input.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design Development – This stage refines the agreed upon
                schematic design for a clearer definition of the scope and
                quality of the finished project. Further cost projections will
                determine how closely the design conforms to the budget
                expectations, or what, if any, adjustments are required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Construction Documents – When the design concepts have been
                decided, the architect prepares working drawings and
                specifications. These are required to obtain building permits
                and bids, and to guide the contractor in construction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bidding and Negotiation – Your architect can advise you on your
                choice of contractor – usually done by calling for competitive
                bids. Your architect will help evaluate the bids and select the
                contractor, and prepare the contract between you and the
                contractor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Construction and Contract Administration – Your architect will
                consult with you and advise you during construction. On-site
                visits will determine if construction is proceeding in general
                accordance with the contract, and that the design, materials,
                and workmanship meet with acceptable standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Substantial Performance of Construction / Occupancy Certificate
                – Your architect provides regular progress reports to keep you
                informed, authorizes staged payments to the contractor and
                remains involved until the project is completed.
              </li>
