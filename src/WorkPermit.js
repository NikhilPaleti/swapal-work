            Anyone who meets the criteria and requirements set by the European countries can work in Europe. 
            Most European states have their programs, through which they tend to lure foreign professionals and fill job shortages in different fields in the country.

            The Schengen work visa does not exist. You can get a Schengen visa for other purposes, as Tourism, Visiting family and friends, business, medical purposes, etc. 
            However, you cannot get a Schengen visa to work in Europe. You are not permitted to work while holding a Schengen visa for other purposes, as well.
            Still, you can work in the Schengen Area if you hold a National (D) Visa for employment purposes issued by one of the 27 European countries part of the Schengen Zone.

                    When to Apply for a Visa to Work in Europe
                </span>
                <br />
                You are highly advised to apply for a work visa to Europe at least two months prior to your trip to the Schengen country where you plan to work in.
