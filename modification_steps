Create Page (Don't Delete. Backup is good.)
To add/remove a page - 
1. Goto App.js 
2. Add, or Comment the <Route> tag for the specific page. Comment the import as well. 
3. Goto NavBar.js 
4. Add, Comment, or Modify <MenuItem> for the change that is required. Remember - There are 2 complete sets of <MenuItem> lists. One is for Desktop, one is for phone, both must be changed.
